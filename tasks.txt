Generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5

================================================================================
WEEK 1: FOUNDATIONS
================================================================================

Day 1: Hello, World!
Concepts: Basic syntax, printf, compilation
Task: Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
Bonus: Print it 5 times using a loop.

Day 2: Temperature Converter
Concepts: Variables, scanf, arithmetic operations
Task: Create a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
      Prompt the user for a temperature in Celsius and display the result.
      Formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32

Day 3: Even or Odd
Concepts: Conditionals (if/else), modulo operator
Task: Ask the user for a number and determine if it's even or odd.
      Print an appropriate message.

Day 4: Sum Calculator
Concepts: Loops (for/while), accumulation
Task: Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to N, where N is provided by
      the user. Display the result.

Day 5: Multiplication Table
Concepts: Nested loops, formatting
Task: Print a multiplication table from 1 to 10.
      Format it nicely with aligned columns.

Day 6: Character Counter
Concepts: Strings, string length, char arrays
Task: Ask the user for a sentence and count how many times a specific
      character appears. Prompt for both the sentence and the character to
      search for.

Day 7: Palindrome Checker
Concepts: String manipulation, arrays, logic
Task: Check if a word entered by the user is a palindrome (reads the same
      forwards and backwards).
      Example: "racecar" is a palindrome, "hello" is not.

================================================================================
WEEK 2: ARRAYS & FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

Day 8: Array Maximum
Concepts: Arrays, iteration
Task: Create an array of 10 integers (hardcoded or user input).
      Find and print the maximum value in the array.

Day 9: Array Reverser
Concepts: Array manipulation, swapping
Task: Take an array of numbers and reverse it in place.
      Print the original and reversed arrays.

Day 10: Simple Function
Concepts: Functions, parameters, return values
Task: Write a function that takes two integers and returns their sum.
      Write another function that returns the larger of two numbers.
      Test both functions in main().

Day 11: Factorial Calculator
Concepts: Recursion or iteration, functions
Task: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
      Handle the case where n = 0 (should return 1).

Day 12: Prime Number Checker
Concepts: Functions, loops, conditionals
Task: Write a function that determines if a number is prime.
      Test it with several numbers and print the results.

Day 13: Fibonacci Sequence
Concepts: Loops, sequences, variables
Task: Generate and print the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
      User provides N.

Day 14: Bubble Sort
Concepts: Sorting algorithms, nested loops, swapping
Task: Implement bubble sort to sort an array of integers.
      Print the array before and after sorting.

================================================================================
WEEK 3: POINTERS & MEMORY
================================================================================

Day 15: Pointer Basics
Concepts: Pointers, addresses, dereferencing
Task: Create variables and pointers. Print their values and addresses.
      Use a pointer to modify a variable's value.

Day 16: Swap Function
Concepts: Pass by reference, pointers as parameters
Task: Write a function that swaps two integers using pointers.
      Test it in main() to verify the swap works.

Day 17: Dynamic Array
Concepts: malloc, free, dynamic memory
Task: Create an array of user-specified size using malloc.
      Fill it with values, print them, then free the memory.

Day 18: String Length Function
Concepts: Pointers, strings, char*
Task: Write your own strlen() function using pointer arithmetic.
      Don't use the standard library strlen.

Day 19: Array Sum with Pointers
Concepts: Pointer arithmetic, arrays
Task: Write a function that takes an array (as a pointer) and its size.
      Return the sum of all elements using pointer arithmetic only.

Day 20: String Copier
Concepts: Pointers, memory, string manipulation
Task: Write a function that copies one string to another (like strcpy).
      Use pointers and allocate memory as needed.

Day 21: Struct Introduction
Concepts: Structures, dot notation
Task: Create a Student struct with name, age, and grade fields.
      Create a few students and print their information.

================================================================================
WEEK 4: ADVANCED CONCEPTS
================================================================================

Day 22: Array of Structs
Concepts: Arrays of structures, iteration
Task: Create an array of 5 students.
      Write a function to find the student with the highest grade.

Day 23: File Writing
Concepts: File I/O, fopen, fprintf, fclose
Task: Write a program that creates a file and writes 10 numbers to it.
      Each number on a new line.

Day 24: File Reading
Concepts: File I/O, fscanf, reading data
Task: Read the file from Day 23 and calculate the average of the numbers.
      Print the result.

Day 25: Simple Calculator
Concepts: Switch statements, functions, user input
Task: Create a calculator that supports +, -, *, /.
      Use a switch statement to handle the operations.
      Keep running until the user chooses to quit.

Day 26: Number Guessing Game
Concepts: Random numbers, loops, conditionals
Task: Generate a random number between 1-100.
      Let the user guess until they get it right.
      Provide "higher" or "lower" hints.

Day 27: Word Frequency Counter
Concepts: Strings, arrays, searching
Task: Count how many times each unique word appears in a sentence.
      Store words and their counts (simple approach with small vocabulary).

Day 28: Matrix Addition
Concepts: 2D arrays, nested loops
Task: Create two 3x3 matrices and add them together.
      Print the original matrices and the result.

Day 29: Command Line Arguments
Concepts: argc, argv, command-line processing
Task: Write a program that takes numbers as command-line arguments.
      Print their sum and average.

Day 30: Caesar Cipher
Concepts: Character manipulation, algorithms
Task: Implement a Caesar cipher to encrypt a message.
      Shift each letter by a specified amount.

Day 31: Final Challenge - Phonebook
Concepts: Everything combined!
Task: Create a simple phonebook program:
      - Store names and phone numbers (array of structs)
      - Add new entries
      - Search by name
      - Display all entries
      - Save to/load from a file
      Keep it simple - max 10 entries is fine!
